# Starbuck-unofficial-site

## Clone site of Starbuck offical site

-It is an unofficial site that i try clone from the official site. I am so happy to see that i was able to make this site.
I will soon be working on my new project and try to upload it next week.

-This project is not based on purley html only, It has mnay work of css and js also

-You will find many part of html added from js, As I was trying to make a good dynamic site. like from getting_started_section or extra_section

-You can see side menu, amazing moving underline , pic update or option in menu_offer

-It took me like 6 days to made, I wonder if it is too long

-I did not add footer as I thought it to be unncessary

-This site is made from html,css and js

Hope you like my project
